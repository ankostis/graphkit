Lightweight computation graphs for Python
-----------------------------------------

**Graphtik** is a library to design, plot & execute *graphs of functions*
(a.k.a :term:`pipeline`\s) that consume and populate (possibly :term:`nested
<hierarchical data>`) data, based on whether values for those data (a.k.a :term:`dependencies
<dependency>`) exist.

- The API posits a fair compromise between :ref:`features` and complexity, without precluding any.
- It can be used as is to build machine learning pipelines for data science projects.
- It should be extendable to act as the core for a custom ETL engine, a workflow-processor
  for interdependent tasks & files like GNU Make, or a spreadsheet calculation engine.

Graph\ **tik** `sprang <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPgtg2l6v3uDS81hLOcFOZxIBLCnHGrcFOh3pFRIDio/edit#gid=0>`_
from `Graphkit`_ (summer 2019, v1.2.2) to :gh:`experiment <22>` with Python 3.6+ features,
but has diverged significantly with enhancements ever since.

Quick start
-----------

Here's how to install::

   pip install graphtik

OR with dependencies for plotting support (and you need to install `Graphviz`_ program
separately with your OS tools)::

   pip install graphtik[plot]


Let's build a *graphtik* computation :term:`pipeline` that produces x3 :term:`outputs`
out of 2 :term:`inputs` `a` and `b`:

.. math::

   a \times b

   a - a \times b

   |a - a \times b| ^ 3

..

   >>> from graphtik import compose, operation
   >>> from operator import mul, sub

   >>> @operation(name="abs qubed",
   ...            needs=["a_minus_ab"],
   ...            provides=["abs_a_minus_ab_cubed"])
   ... def abs_qubed(a):
   ...    return abs(a) ** 3

Compose the ``abspow`` function along with ``mul`` & ``sub``  built-ins
into a computation :term:`graph`:

   >>> graphop = compose("graphop",
   ...    operation(mul, needs=["a", "b"], provides=["ab"]),
   ...    operation(sub, needs=["a", "ab"], provides=["a_minus_ab"]),
   ...    abs_qubed,
   ... )
   >>> graphop
   Pipeline('graphop', needs=['a', 'b', 'ab', 'a_minus_ab'],
                     provides=['ab', 'a_minus_ab', 'abs_a_minus_ab_cubed'],
                     x3 ops: mul, sub, abs qubed)

You may plot the function graph in a file like this
(if in *jupyter*, no need to specify the file, see :ref:`jupyter_rendering`):

   >>> graphop.plot('graphop.svg')      # doctest: +SKIP

.. graphtik::

As you can see, any function can be used as an operation in Graphtik,
even ones imported from system modules.

Run the graph-operation and request all of the outputs:

   >>> sol = graphop(**{'a': 2, 'b': 5})
   >>> sol
   {'a': 2, 'b': 5, 'ab': 10, 'a_minus_ab': -8, 'abs_a_minus_ab_cubed': 512}

:term:`Solutions <solution>` are :term:`plottable` as well:

   >>> solution.plot('solution.svg')      # doctest: +SKIP

.. graphtik::

Run the graph-operation and request a subset of the outputs:

   >>> solution = graphop.compute({'a': 2, 'b': 5}, outputs=["a_minus_ab"])
   >>> solution
   {'a_minus_ab': -8}

.. graphtik::

... where the (interactive) legend is this:

.. graphtik::
   :width: 65%
   :name: legend

   >>> from graphtik.plot import legend
   >>> l = legend()
