Operations
==========

At a high level, an :term:`operation` is a function in a computation :term:`pipeline`,
abstractly represented by the :class:`.Operation` class.
This class specifies the :term:`dependencies <dependency>` of the *operation*
in the *pipeline*.

You may inherit this class and access the declared values in :term:`needs` from :term:`solution`
and produce the declared :term:`provides` when :meth:`Operation.compute()` method is called.
But there is an easier way...actually half of the code of this project is to retrofit
existing functions into *operations*.


Operations from existing functions
----------------------------------
The :class:`.FunctionalOperation` provides a concrete lightweight wrapper
around any arbitrary function to define those *dependencies*.
Instead of constructing it directly, prefer to instantiate it by calling
the :func:`.operation()` factory:

   >>> from operator import add
   >>> from graphtik import operation

   >>> add_op = operation(add,
   ...                    needs=['a', 'b'],
   ...                    provides=['a_plus_b'])
   >>> add_op
   FunctionalOperation(name='add', needs=['a', 'b'], provides=['a_plus_b'], fn='add')

You may still call the original function, by accessing the :attr:`.FunctionalOperation.fn`
attribute:

   >>> add_op.fn(3, 4) == add(3, 4)
   True

   But that is just for a quick experimentation - it does not perform any checks
   or matching of *needs*/*provides* to function arguments & results
   (which happen when :term:`pipeline`\s :term:`compute`).

   The way Graphtik works is by invoking their :meth:`.Operation.compute()` method,
   which, among others, allow to specify what results you desire to receive back
   (read more on :ref:`graph-computations`).


Builder pattern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two ways to instantiate a :class:`.FunctionalOperation`\s, each one suitable
for different scenarios.

We've seen that calling manually :func:`.operation()` allows putting into a pipeline
functions that are defined elsewhere (e.g. in another module, or are system functions).

But that method is also useful if you want to create multiple operation instances
with similar attributes, e.g. ``needs``:

   >>> op_factory = operation(needs=['a'])

Notice that we specified a `fn`, in order to get back a :class:`.FunctionalOperation`
instance (and not a decorator).

   >>> from graphtik import operation, compose
   >>> from functools import partial

   >>> def mypow(a, p=2):
   ...    return a ** p

   >>> pow_op2 = op_factory.withset(fn=mypow, provides="^2")
   >>> pow_op3 = op_factory.withset(fn=partial(mypow, p=3), name='pow_3', provides='^3')
   >>> pow_op0 = op_factory.withset(fn=lambda a: 1, name='pow_0', provides='^0')

   >>> graphop = compose('powers', pow_op2, pow_op3, pow_op0)
   >>> graphop
   NetworkOperation('powers', needs=['a'], provides=['^2', '^3', '^0'], x3 ops:
      mypow, pow_3, pow_0)


   >>> graphop(a=2)
   {'a': 2, '^2': 4, '^3': 8, '^0': 1}

  See :ref:`plotting` on how to make diagrams like this.


Decorator specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are defining your computation graph and the functions that comprise it all in the same script,
the decorator specification of ``operation`` instances might be particularly useful,
as it allows you to assign computation graph structure to functions as they are defined.
Here's an example:

   >>> from graphtik import operation, compose

   >>> @operation(needs=['b', 'a', 'r'], provides='bar')
   ... def foo(a, b, c):
   ...   return c * (a + b)

   >>> graphop = compose('foo_graph', foo)

.. graphtik::

- Notice that if ``name`` is not given, it is deduced from the function name.


Specifying graph structure: ``provides`` and ``needs``
------------------------------------------------------
Each :term:`operation` is a node in a computation :term:`graph`,
depending and supplying data from and to other nodes (via the :term:`solution`),
in order to :term:`compute`.

This graph structure is specified (mostly) via the ``provides`` and ``needs`` arguments
to the :func:`.operation` factory, specifically:

``needs``
   this argument names the list of (positionally ordered) :term:`inputs` data the `operation`
   requires to receive from *solution*.
   The list corresponds, roughly, to the arguments of the underlying function
   (plus any :term:`sideffects`).

   It can be a single string, in which case a 1-element iterable is assumed.

   :seealso: :term:`needs`, :term:`modifier`, :attr:`.FunctionalOperation.needs`,
      :attr:`.FunctionalOperation.op_needs`, :attr:`.FunctionalOperation._fn_needs`

``provides``
   this argument names the list of (positionally ordered) :term:`outputs` data
   the operation provides into the *solution*.
   The list corresponds, roughly, to the returned values of the `fn`
   (plus any :term:`sideffects` & :term:`alias`\es).

   It can be a single string, in which case a 1-element iterable is assumed.

   If they are more than one, the underlying function must return an iterable
   with same number of elements (unless it :term:`returns dictionary`).

   :seealso: :term:`provides`, :term:`modifier`, :attr:`.FunctionalOperation.provides`,
      :attr:`.FunctionalOperation.op_provides`, :attr:`.FunctionalOperation._fn_provides`

Declarations of *needs* and *provides* is affected by :term:`modifier`\s like
:func:`.mapped`:

Map inputs to different function arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. autofunction:: graphtik.modifiers.mapped
   :noindex:

Execute operations with missing inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. autofunction:: graphtik.modifiers.optional
   :noindex:

Calling functions with varargs (``*args``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. autofunction:: graphtik.modifiers.vararg
   :noindex:
.. autofunction:: graphtik.modifiers.varargs
   :noindex:


.. _aliases:

Aliased `provides`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sometimes, you need to interface functions & operations where they name a
:term:`dependency` differently.
This is doable without introducing "pipe-through" interface operation, either
by annotating certain `needs` with :func:`.mapped` `modifiers` (above), or
by :term:`alias`\sing certain `provides` to different names:

   >>> op = operation(str,
   ...                name="`provides` with `aliases`",
   ...                needs="anything",
   ...                provides="real thing",
   ...                aliases=("real thing", "phony"))

.. graphtik::


Considerations for when building pipelines
------------------------------------------
When many operations are composed into a computation graph, Graphtik matches up
the values in their *needs* and *provides* to form the edges of that graph
(see :ref:`graph-composition` for more on that), like the operations from the script
in :ref:`quick-start`:

   >>> from operator import mul, sub
   >>> from functools import partial
   >>> from graphtik import compose, operation

   >>> def abspow(a, p):
   ...   """Compute |a|^p. """
   ...   c = abs(a) ** p
   ...   return c

   >>> # Compose the mul, sub, and abspow operations into a computation graph.
   >>> graphop = compose("graphop",
   ...    operation(mul, needs=["a", "b"], provides=["ab"]),
   ...    operation(sub, needs=["a", "ab"], provides=["a_minus_ab"]),
   ...    operation(name="abspow1", needs=["a_minus_ab"], provides=["abs_a_minus_ab_cubed"])
   ...    (partial(abspow, p=3))
   ... )
   >>> graphop
   NetworkOperation('graphop',
                    needs=['a', 'b', 'ab', 'a_minus_ab'],
                    provides=['ab', 'a_minus_ab', 'abs_a_minus_ab_cubed'],
                    x3 ops: mul, sub, abspow1)


- Notice the use of :func:`functools.partial()` to set parameter ``p`` to a constant value.
- And this is done by calling once more the returned "decorator* from :func:`operation()`,
  when called without a functions.

The ``needs`` and ``provides`` arguments to the operations in this script define
a computation graph that looks like this:

.. graphtik::
